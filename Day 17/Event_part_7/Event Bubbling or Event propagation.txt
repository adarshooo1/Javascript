Event bubbling is the process by which an event triggered on a nested element
"bubbles up" through its ancestors in the document object model (DOM) until it
reaches the outermost ancestor. This means that when an event occurs on a child 
element, it will also trigger any event listeners attached to its parent, grandparent,
and so on, up to the root of the document. Event bubbling is the default behavior in
most modern web browsers.
