Event delegation is a technique used to handle events efficiently by
attaching a single event listener to a parent element rather than multiple
event listeners to its nested children. This is achieved by taking advantage
of event bubbling, where an event that occurs on a child element will also
propagate up to its parent element. When the parent element receives the event,
it can use the event.target property to determine which child element the event
originated from and perform the necessary action.
