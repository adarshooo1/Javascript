Intro to Events:
In JavaScript, an event is any user or browser action that triggers some code to run. Events can include mouse clicks, mouse movements, keyboard inputs, and more.

To handle events in JavaScript, you typically use event listeners. An event listener is a function that is called whenever a specific event occurs. To add an event listener to an element, you can use the addEventListener method, like this:

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
javascript

const button = document.querySelector('button');

button.addEventListener('click', function() {
  // code to run when the button is clicked
});

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

In this example, the addEventListener method is called on the button element, with the event type 'click' and a callback function that will be called when the button is clicked.

There are many different types of events that can be handled in JavaScript, and you can find a full list of them in the MDN Web Docs. Some commonly used events include:

1.click: Triggered when a mouse button is clicked on an element.
2.keydown: Triggered when a key on the keyboard is pressed down while an element has focus.
3.mousemove: Triggered when the mouse is moved over an element.
4.submit: Triggered when a form is submitted.
By handling events in JavaScript, you can create interactive and dynamic web applications that respond to user input.
