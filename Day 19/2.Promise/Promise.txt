you ask your friend to bring you a toy from their house.
They promise to bring it to you, but they might take some
time to find it and bring it back.

In JavaScript, a promise works the same way. You ask your
code to do something, and it promises to do it for you, but
it might take some time to complete the task.

When the task is done, the promise will either give you the
result you asked for, or it will tell you that something went wrong.
So, just like with your friend, you can trust that the promise will
come through for you, even if it takes a little bit of time.
