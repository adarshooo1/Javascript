Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)
Ajax is a web development technique used to create fast and dynamic web
pages. It allows web pages to request and receive data from the server without requiring a page refresh,
which makes web applications more responsive and interactive.

Ajax uses a combination of technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and XML or JSON
(JavaScript Object Notation), to update parts of a web page asynchronously, without requiring the user
to reload the entire page. Instead, Ajax sends and receives data in the background,
making the web application feel more like a desktop application.

Ajax is widely used in modern web development and is supported by most web browsers.
It has many applications, including dynamic form validation, search engine autosuggest,
and real-time chat. However, it can also introduce security vulnerabilities if not implemented properly,
such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Basic Theory:

Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.
We need to know HTTP requests , call API , creating data in the server , updating data in the server. So, Basically communication between client and Server

is a set if "web Development techniques"
using many web technologies in the "client-side'
to create Asynchronous web application.

With Ajax , web application can send and retrieve
data from a server asynchronously (in the background)
without interfering with the display and behaviour
of the existing page

we don't use data in xml format anymore
we use json now. 

We have 3 mos commin ways to create and send request to server.
1.xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing)
2.fetch application (new way of doing)
3.Axioz (this is a third party library)
